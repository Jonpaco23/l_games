# Overview
Fitts-maze is a game for the Bionik In-Motion Robot Arm that generates a random maze for users to traverse. Users can adjust the difficulty of the task either assisting with movement throughout the maze or resistance as requested.

This game can be used in conjunction with an EEG to gather data on human locomotion which can be used to train SNNs in the future.

# Installation and Usage
Tcl/Tk comes pre-installed on most Unix/Linux distributions. If it is not, it can be installed using the command ```apt-get install tcl```. The only other requirements to run this game are several files that should come preinstalled on the Bionik In-Motion Arm Robot:
- shm.tcl in crobhome
- util.tcl in common
- menu.tcl in common
- i18n.tcl in I18N_HOME

To run this game, run the command ```tclsh fitts-maze.tcl``` from the directory where the file is located. Upon running, this menu will appear:

Sequential mode will increase the current level by 1 each time a level is completed by reaching the green square (each additional level will add 2 new squares to the maze). Incremental mode will increase the level by the amount specified in the slider below.

To play, move the arm of the Bionik In-Motion Robot to guide the dot through the maze.

# Logic and Creation
To create the maze, the screen is divided into a 10 x 10 grid. The maze is generated by first randomly creating a path where each part of the path is assigned a direction (or in the current example, the maze is preprogrammed in). The path is stored as a global variable and is used to draw elements of the maze as needed later on.

We draw the maze by creating various T-shapes that connect to form the maze. Each T-shape allows a left or a right turn to be made, creating an efficient way to draw all possible turns. These T-shapes are created by drawing two lines in each grid space.

Once the maze is drawn, the next step is to create the movebox. The movebox allows force to be applied to the arm which can either resist or assist movement. A movebox can be created with a set of two coordinates, one representing the start point and one representing the end point. A timer can also be indicated when initializing the movebox which will determine how fast the box closes. As the box closes, a force is applied to anything outside of the box, naturally moving the arm toward the endpoint. We can determine the location of this movebox based on the direction of the path.

# Bug Fixes and Features to Implement
* Smooth out arm movement with assistance modes
* Modify the menu to include more options
  - Assistance or Resistance
  - Strength of assistance/resistance
  - Maze generation difficulty
* Random maze generation (currently uses preprogrammed path)
* Change variable naming scheme
